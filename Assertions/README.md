## About
According to Oxford Languages, to assert is *to state clearly and definitely that something is true.* As such, I wanted to create a place for people to contribute assertions about me that they believe to be true. This directory's purpose is to hold those assertions made by others, because while my Manager Readme is essentially just a set of assertions I've made about myself, I want to experiment with this concept and extend it to include perspectives outside of my own. This directory might very well sit empty forever, and that'd be ok - that's why it's an experiment!

## Contributing 
If you'd like to add an attestation for me, firstly, thank you for taking the time to do so! 
Simply fork this repo (from ```main```) or use a codespace and open a PR!

There are two ways you can contribute: 
- Quick (one or two sentences, memes, song lyrics, quotes, whatever!)
- Long (more than that)

Quick assertions can be added directly to this file in the section below and longer assertions can be added to the ```Assertions``` directory as a markdown file. I have no preference for format, but I ask that you include the years we worked together, context for our relationship, and if you're comfortable, your name. As an example (real statement made by my 5 year old daughter 😆):
> Mom is good at feeding Calvin  - Roommates since 2018 - Cori

## Background
Inspired by a friend of mine [Tony Morris](https://blog.morriscloud.com/readme/), I decided it would be a fun exercise to create a manager Readme. If nothing it else, it gave me the opportunity to sit and reflect about my own leadership style.  Then, in an interview, I was asked a question that I loved, "If I had to interview people who you've managed or lead in the past, what would they say about you?" This is similar to a question I like asking in interiews, "What has been the most impactful piece of constructive criticism you have recieved, and why was it impactful?" This got me thinking that I wish I would have saved more of the feedback I've been given over the years. I don't particularly like how LinkedIn Recommendations work as they just seem a little forced, and it doesn't seem to lend itself to holding some of the tougher sentiments. So I thought I would try and crowd source some of this! At the very least, maybe I can use this to record feedback I've received going forward to compliment my manager Readme.

### Disclaimer
If you've stumbled here and don't find any assertions, please don't hold it against me. This is an experiment and even if learn this isn't the best way to approach this, that's ok with me 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

## Assertions
Please add asserts here 👇🏻! (Doesn't have to be bullet form - anywhere in this section is fine!)
